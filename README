jQuery Colour Clock
-------------------

A simple jQuery-based clock which changes the background colour of the page dependent
on the current seconds value

__Feel free to fork or add your own modifications! My only ask is that you leave the original file as
is for new commits__

### Possible new features

_These are just ideas I might like to try one day, or maybe an ideas list for others ..._

- Use linear gradients in the background to give the appearence of scrolling colour
- Use of HSL instead of RGB (jQuery doesn't support this yet I believe)
